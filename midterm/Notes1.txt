HTTP

used to communicate and data transfer between users web and clients software
pretty much this is how we get stuff to show on our page


some request methods are
get head post put delete trace these are also shows in using apis

https help authenticate server privacy and integrity
https is http but incrypted using tls


Depending on what browser you use you could have your page render(from html) differently

1. GET http command
2. gets file for html in root
3. for each determined request make sure it is a fresh copy 
4. if its recent meaning fresh and in cash then use the cashed copy
5.if it doesnt exist use GET and cashe it 
6. get the jpg and display it 



Lecture 2 HTML BASICS


W3C make the rules for html and work with a lot of browsers. They decide the format of html.

    Forms have hiddent inputs 
     <input type="hidden" name="somename" value ="some value">
        users cannot see this| used to allow server to implant data ni the html page then read those data when form is
        subbmited without the user noticing 
        

 <input type="text" placeholder="text" pattern ="is what the input can take [a-z] [0-9]">


    <datalist> </datalist> is a drop down menu that autocompletes you text so typing a letter shows words that could match what 
    you are typing

    use post in forms with sensitive data becuase it doesnt show in the url 


    Css

    you would use something like display none if you want to change something dynamically
